# Firefox-Landing-Page
Custom landing page for Firefox, using colour theme based off [Atom One Dark](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/85269)

Using the [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) extension for Firefox, one can set a custom start page for new tabs. One limitation however is that it does not (currently) support splitting the CSS and JS into seperate files, thus everything is contained in one HTML file.
